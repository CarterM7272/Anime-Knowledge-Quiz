# Anime-Quiz

## Motivation

I made this quiz to test my colleagues on their anime knowledge. 

## How to use?
  Click on the start button and a series of anime questions will pop up. You have 100 seconds to complete the quiz, if you get a wrong answer then 10 seconds is subtracted. If the user gets the answer correct then the next question will appear. After all questions are completed or timer runs out then user can submit their name and score to the high-score board.
